# 🏋️ Workout Analytics — Personal Experiment

This repository is a **personal experiment** I built to log and analyze **my own workouts**.

I wasn’t trying to build a fitness app or a polished product.  
I just wanted a better way to understand **what my training actually looks like** once you step back and look at the data.

Over time, the scripts grew a bit, the ideas got clearer, and the project slowly became more structured.

## Why I Built This

I train with a simple push / pull / core split and wanted to visualize if everything is balanced. I decided to log everything and see what falls out.

## What This Is (and What It Isn’t)

### This *is*
- A personal logging + analysis tool
- Built specifically around my own routines
- Session-based (not calendar-based)
- Simple, explainable, and hackable
- A place to experiment with analytics ideas

### This *is not*
- A commercial fitness app
- A universal training recommendation system
- A biomechanical or medical model
- Something meant to replace a coach or common sense

All numbers here represent **relative training stimulus**, nothing more.

## Ideas I’m Playing With

- Mapping exercises to muscle groups in a simple way
- Collapsing many muscles into a few “big picture” groups
- Looking at training in terms of **sessions**, not weeks
- Comparing push vs pull from two angles:
  - muscle fatigue
  - exercise programming
- Tracking routine-level overload (push / pull / core)
- Very lightweight recovery and readiness heuristics
